Building at the intersection of **computation**, **cognition**, and **first principles**.

Systems that learn, adapt, and reason, not just execute.


### Now

Verifiable foundations. Massively parallel runtimes. Unified models of complex systems.

Everything minimal: small footprint, zero dependencies where possible, auditable from source.


### Stack

**Languages** · Zig · Swift · TypeScript · Rust · Python · C  
**Targets** · Metal · Accelerate · Interaction nets · WebGPU · Bun  
**Thinking** · Category theory · Predictive coding · Topology


Open to interesting problems.
